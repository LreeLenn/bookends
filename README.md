# Bookends

A small library built on top of [Bookshelfjs](http://bookshelfjs.org/) which enables you to easily retrieve a complex tree of data from your SQL database.

This library is young and currently very experimental, but it's based on code I wrote for [Metamorfus](https://metamorf.us). My overall goal is to extract the more interesting bits from Metamorfus into open source libraries, then finally open source Metamorfus itself.

## Super early stuff here

These are not the droids you're looking for just yet.

Once Bookends shapes itself up, I'll expand this README and tweet, write a [blog post](http://mattgreer.org), etc.

## lots of releases, many versions

I'm really following semantic versioning to the letter, which basically says for 0.x releases to go crazy and use this time to figure out the overall API. Each new 0.x release is essentially one more feature, even if it's just a tiny feature. Once 1.x is hit, versioning will settle down.

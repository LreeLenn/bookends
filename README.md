# Bookends

A small library built on top of [Bookshelfjs](http://bookshelfjs.org/) which enables you to easily retrieve a complex tree of data from your SQL database.

This library is young and currently very experimental, but it's based on code I wrote for [Metamorfus](https://metamorf.us). My overall goal is to extract the more interesting bits from Metamorfus into open source libraries, then finally open source Metamorfus itself.

## Super early stuff here

These are not the droids you're looking for just yet.

Once Bookends shapes itself up, I'll expand this README and tweet, write a [blog post](http://mattgreer.org), etc.
